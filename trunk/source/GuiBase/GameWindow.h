/*! \mainpage libwiisprite Documentation
 * \image html libwiisprite.png
 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * libwiisprite is a sprite library, created to help developers make homebrew games
 * and applications for the Wii. It was coded in C++ and makes good use of OOP concepts.
 *
 * libwiisprite makes it easy and fun to make games for the Wii.
 *
 * \section Quickstart
 * Just browse the Classes from the menu above. To add all of them to your project with
 * one command, use
\code
#include <wiisprite.h>
\endcode
 *
 * If you want to start as soon as possible, use the template example in the libwiisprite/examples folder as your base, and check out the spritetest and invaders examples. These will help you understand the concepts of this library.
 *
 * \section concepts_sec Explanations
 * This is for quick explaining what we mean with all these terms we use throughout the
 * library. They can help you get started on the more "advanced" features of this library.

 * \section contact_sec Contact
 *
 * If you have any suggestions for the library or documentation, please mail
 * Chaosteil [at] gmail [dot] com or gummybassist [at] gmail [dot] com.
 * We are also happy to help with most of the problems that aren't explained in this
 * documentation.

/*! \page global_coord_page Global - Coordinate system
 * The coordinate system are the X and Y positions on the screen and in which direction everything
 * goes. It is a two dimensional (2D) cartesian coordinate system with inverted vertical axis.
 *
 * This snippet explains it in a simple way:
 \verbatim
 Coordinates:
 .------------> X (640, horizontal)
 |
 |
 |    Coordinate system starts at (0;0).
 |
 |
 V Y (480, vertical)
 \endverbatim
 * The top left is (0;0), the bottom right is (640;480). Of course the positions
 * can also be negative or bigger than said bottom right corner.
